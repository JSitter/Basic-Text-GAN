[[Image:Maillot blanc red-wings.JPG|thumb|200px|The Detroit Red Wings strip]]== History ===== Early history ===The Red Wings were formed in 1926.  The [[Western Canada Hockey Leagu] (WCHL) folded that year, and many of the players from the WCHL's [[Victoria Couga went to play for Detroit.  As a result, the team was first called the Detroit Cougars, then later it changed to Detroit Falcons, before becoming known as the Red Wings.=== Later history ===In the late [[1940], the [[line (sports)|lin] of Sid Abel, [[Gordie How], and Ted Lindsey became very important to the team.  Abel won the Hart Trophy in 1949, and Lindsey won the [[Art Ross Troph] as scoring champion in 1950.  Howe then won six Hart and six Art Ross Trophies between 1951 and 1963.  Terry Sawchuck was a star [[goaltend, who ended up with more career [[shutou]s than any other goalie (103).  Red Kelly won the first ever [[Norris Troph] as best defence.  As a result of having such great players, the Red Wings won four Stanley Cups in six years:  1950, 1952, 1954, and 1955.  Two of these were very close:  they were won in [[overtim] of the 7th and deciding game in 1950 (against the [[New York Range) and 1954 (against the Montreal Canadiens).  These are the only two times the NHL championship has gone to overtime of game seven.The Red Wings continued to be a strong team throughout the [[1960]].  They lost the NHL Finals five times between 1956 and 1966.  Norm Ullman was their star center in the 1960s.=== Comeback ===They were not a strong team again until the late 1980s.  Steve Yzerman became a star at this time.  Sergei Fedorov became the first [[Russi]n to win the Hart Trophy in 1994.  The Red Wings won the [[President's Cup]] as top team in the NHL regular season in 1995, 1996 (with a record number of wins), and 2002.  They won the Stanley Cup in 1997, 1998, and 2002.  Nicklas Lidstrom won the [[Norris Troph] as best defenceman three times beginning in 2001.  The team was one of the richest in the NHL, which helped them get many good players.== Winnings ==The Red Wings have won eleven [[Stanley Cup]]s, the third most of any team, and the most of the United States teams. They first won in 1936 and 1937, and again in 1943. Ebbie Goodfellow won the [[Hart Troph] as the NHL's [[most valuable play in 1940.  Sid Howe was also a star on the team at this time.==Related pages==*[[List of Detroit Red Wings playe==Other websites==*[http://redwings.nhl.com/ Official websit[[Category:Detroit Red Wings| ]][[Category:1926 establishmen\",\n",

The [[Frankfurt International Airpor] is the largest in Germany, and the third biggest in the world. Frankfurt's train station is one of the largest, and its highway crossing is the centre of Germany's street network. Frankfurt is the seat of the [[European Central Bank]], the German Federal Bank (Bundesbank) and of the biggest German banks, and it has an important [[stock exchan where [[share (finance)|shar of German companies are traded.Frankfurt is on the [[Main]] river. The city's name means ''ford of the Franks'' - a [[ford]] is a place in a river where it is so shallow that you can walk through it, and the [[Frank] were a [[Germanic peopl] which existed in the first [[millenniu]. So, this was a place where travellers could cross the river without a boat. The frankish [[kin]s built a [[palac] and a [[church]] here. Over the [[century|centuri, this group of buildings grew to be a big city which was famous for international [[trad] and [[fai]s, like today. Frankfurt was one of the most important cities of the [[Holy Roman Empi, and its [[empers were crowned here.

[[Tr lines were constructed to make travelling inside the growing city easier. In [[World War I], the old city was totally destroyed by airplane bomber attacks. After the war, Germany was divided into two parts, and Frankfurt became the economic capital of [[West German] while [[Bonn]] was chosen to be the political capital.Frankfurt is a very international city. Every third inhabitant is not German. Most immigrants come from southeastern [[Europ], [[Turke] and [[North Afric], but there are people from almost every country living in Frankfurt.

This left the earlier Ordovician [[limeston] sitting on top of the later Silurian brownish [[mudston]] Geology is the study of the nonliving things that the [[Earth]] is made of. Geology is the study of [[Rock (geology)|rock] in the [[Earth\\'s crus]. People who study geology are called geologists. Some geologists study [[miners and the useful substances the rocks contain (such as natural [[g and [[oi]). Geologists also study the [[history of the Earth]]. Some of the important [[even]s in the Earth\\'s history are [[flood]]s, [[volcano|volcanic eruption], [[earthquak]s, [[orogen] (mountain building), and [[plate tectonic] (movement of [[continen). Geology is divided into special subjects that study one part of geology. Some of these subjects are: * [[Geomorpholog] – the study of the shape (morphology) of the surface of the Earth.* [[Historical geolog] – the history of the events that shaped the Earth over the last 4.5 million years.* [[Aquifer|Hydrogeolog] – the study of water under the surface of the Earth* [[Palaeontolog] – the study of [[fossi]s* [[Petrolog] – the study of [[Rock (geology)|rock] how they form and where they are from.* [[Mineralog] – the study of [[miners* [[Sedimentolog] – the study of sediments* [[Stratigraph] – the study of layered [[sedimentary rock]]s and how they were deposited.* Structural geology– the study of folds and [[Fault (geology)|faul and how mountains are formed by uplift. See [[Earth scienc]* [[Volcanolog] – the study of [[volcan]es on land or under the [[ocean]]* [[Seismolog] – the study of [[earthquak]s and strong ground-motion.* Engineering geology -the study of geologic hazards (such as [[landslid]s and earthquakes) applied to [[civil engineerin].* Petroleum geology- the study of [[petroleu] deposits in sedimentary rocks.== Types of rock ==Rocks can be very different from each other.  Some are very hard and some are soft.  Some rocks are very common, while others are rare.  However, all the different rocks belong to three categories or types, igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic. * [[Igneous rock]] is rock that has been made by volcanic action.  Igneous rock is made when the [[lav] (melted rock on the surface of the Earth) or magma (melted rock below the surface of the Earth) cools and becomes hard.* [[Sedimentary rock]] is rock that has been made from [[sedimen].  Sediment is solid pieces of stuff that are moved by wind, water, or [[glacis, and dropped somewhere.  Sediment can be made from clay, [[sand]], [[grav and the bodies and [[Animal shell|shell] of animals.  The sediment gets dropped in a layer, usually in water at the bottom of a river or sea.  As the sediment piles up, the lowers layers get squashed together.  Slowly they set hard into rock.* [[Metamorphic rock]] is rock that has been changed.  Sometimes an igneous or a sedimentary rock is heated or squashed under the ground, so that it changes.  Metamorphic rock is often harder than the rock that it was before it changed.  [[Marbl] and [[sla are among the metamorphic rocks that people use to make things.=== Faults ===All three kinds of rock can be changed by being [[hea]ed and [[squeez]d by forces in the earth. When this happens, [[Fault (geology)|faul (cracks) may appear in the rock. Geologists can learn a lot about the history of the rock by studying the patterns of the fault lines. Earthquakes are caused when a fault breaks suddenly.=== Soil ===Soil is the stuff on the ground made of lots of particles (or tiny pieces). The particles of soil come from rocks that have broken down, and from rotting leaves and animals bodies. Soil covers a lot of the surface of the Earth. Plants of all sorts grow in soil.To find out more about types of rocks, see the \\'\\'[[rock (geolog\\'\\' article.To find out more about soil, see the \\'\\'[[soi]\\'\\' article.== Principles of Stratigraphy ==Geologists use some simple ideas which help them to understand the rocks they are studying. The following ideas were worked out in the early days of [[stratigraph] by people like [[Nicolaus Sten], [[James Hutton]] and [[william Smith (geologist)|William Smith]]: # Understanding the past: Geologist [[James Hutton]] said \"The present is the key to the past\". He meant that the sort of changes that are happening to the Earth\\'s surface now are the same sorts of things that happened in the past. Geologists can understand things that happened millions of years ago, by looking at the changes which are happening today.# [[Horizont [[stra: The layers in a sedimentary rock must have been horizontal (flat) when they were deposited (laid down).# The age of the strata: Layers at the bottom must be older than layers at the top, unless all the rocks have been turned over.# In sedimentary rocks that are made of [[sand]] or [[grav, the sand or gravel must have come from an older rock.# The age of [[Fault (geology)|faul: If there is a crack or fault in a rock, then the fault is younger than the rock. Rocks are in strata (lots of layers). A geologist can see if the faults go through all the layer, or only some. This helps to tell the age of the rocks.# The age of a rock which cuts through other rocks: If an [[igneous rock]] cuts across sedimentary layers, it must be younger than the sedimentary rock.# The relative age of [[fossi]s: A fossil in one rock type must be about the same age as the same type of fossil in the same type of rock \\'\\'in a different place\\'\\'. Likewise, a fossil in a rock layer below must be earlier than one in a higher layer.== Gallery ==<gallery> File:Salterncovenorth1.JPG|Layers of [[sedimentar] [[Rock (geology)|rock]]File:Appalachian fault.jpg|A [[Fault (geology)|faul] cutting through older sedimentary rocksFile:Schunemunk conglomerate and pine.jpg|A [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomera: sedimentary rock made from white pieces of older rock, broken up and mixed with red sand at the bottom of a river.File:Zimbabwe great dyke.jpg|The [[Zimbabw] Great [[Dyk]: A big band of [[igneou] rock cuts between sedimentary rocks.
