It is one of four months to have 30 [[day]]s.\\n\\nApril always begins on the same day of week as [[July]], and additionally, [[January]] in leap years. April always ends on the same day of the week as [[December]].\\n\\nApril\\'s [[flower]]s are the [[Sweet Pea]] and [[Asteraceae|Daisy]]. Its [[birthstone]] is the [[diamond]]. The meaning of the diamond is innocence.\\n\\n== The Month ==\\n[[File:Colorful spring garden.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Spring]] flowers in April in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].]]\\nApril comes between [[March]] and [[May]], making it the fourth month of the year. It also comes first in the year out of the four months that have 30 days, as [[June]], [[September]] and [[November]] are later in the year.\\n\\nApril begins on the same day of the week as [[July]] every year and on the same day of the week as [[January]] in [[leap year]]s. April ends on the same day of the week as [[December]] every year, as each others\\' last days are exactly 35 weeks (245 days) apart.\\n\\nIn [[common year|common years]], April starts on the same day of the week as [[October]] of the previous year, and in [[leap year]]s, [[May]] of the previous year. In common years, April finishes on the same day of the week as [[July]] of the previous year, and in leap years, [[February]] and [[October]] of the previous year. In common years immediately after other common years, April starts on the same day of the week as [[January]] of the previous year, and in leap years and years immediately after that, April finishes on the same day of the week as January of the previous year.\\n\\nIn years immediately before common years, April starts on the same day of the week as [[September]] and [[December]] of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, [[June]] of the following year. In years immediately before common years, April finishes on the same day of the week as September of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, [[March]] and June of the following year.\\n\\nApril is a [[spring]] month in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and an [[autumn|autumn/fall]] month in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. In each [[hemisphere]], it is the [[season]]al equivalent of [[October]] in the other.\\n\\nIt is unclear as to where April got its name. A common theory is that it comes from the [[Latin]] word \"aperire\", meaning \"to open\", referring to [[flower]]s opening in [[spring]]. Another theory is that the name could come from [[Aphrodite]], the Greek goddess of [[love]]. It was originally the second month in the old Roman [[Calendar]], before the start of the new year was put to [[January 1]].\\n\\nQuite a few festivals are held in this month. In many [[Southeast Asia]]n cultures, new year is celebrated in this month (including [[Songkran]]). In Western [[Christianity]], [[Easter]] can be celebrated on a [[Sunday]] between [[March 22]] and [[April 25]]. In [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Christianity, it can fall between [[April 4]] and [[May 8]]. At the end of the month, Central and Northern [[Europe]]an [[culture]]s celebrate [[Walpurgis Night]] on [[April 30]], marking the transition from [[winter]] into [[summer]].\\n\\n== April in poetry ==\\n[[poetry|Poets]] use \\'\\'April\\'\\' to mean the end of winter.

The Roman calendar began in March about 735 BC with [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]]. [[October]] was the eighth month. August was the eighth month when January or February were added to the start of the year by King [[Numa Pompilius]] about 700 BC. Or, when those two months were moved from the end to the beginning of the year by the [[decemvirs]] about 450 BC (Roman writers disagree). In [[153 BC]] [[January 1]] was determined as the beginning of the year.\\n\\nAugust is named for [[Augustus Caesar]] who became [[Roman consul]] in this month.&lt;ref name=\"infoplease\"&gt;{{Citation |title=History of August |url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/history-of-august.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The month has 31 days because [[Julius Caesar]] added two days when he created the [[Julian calendar]] in [[45 BC]]. August is after July and before September.\\n\\nAugust, in either [[hemisphere]], is the seasonal equivalent of [[February]] in the other. In the [[Northern hemisphere]] it is a [[summer]] month and it is a [[winter]] month in the [[Southern hemisphere]].\\n\\nNo other month in [[common year|common years]] begins on the same day of the week as August, but August begins on the same day of the week as [[February]] in [[leap year]]s. August ends on the same day of the week as [[November]] every year, as each others\\' last days are 13 weeks (91 days) apart.\\n\\nIn common years, August starts on the same day of the week as [[March]] and [[November]] of the previous year, and in leap years, [[June]] of the previous year.

In common years immediately after other common years, August starts on the same day of the week as February of the previous year.\\n\\nIn years immediately before common years, August starts on the same day of the week as [[May]] of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, [[October]] of the following year.

The artist hopes that it affects the emotions of people who experience it. Artists express themselves by their art. Some people find art relaxing. \\nMany people disagree on how to define art. Some say people are driven to make art due to their inner [[creativity]]. \\n\\nArt includes [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[sculpting]], [[photography]], [[Performing arts|performance art]], [[dance]], [[music]], [[poetry]], [[prose]] and [[theatre]].\\n\\n== Types of art ==\\nArt is divided into the [[plastic arts]], where something is made, and the [[performing arts]], where something is done by humans in action. The other division is between pure arts, done for themselves, and practical arts, done for a practical purpose, but with artistic content.\\n*Plastic arts\\n**Fine art is expression by making something [[Beauty|beautiful]] or appealing to the [[emotion]]s by visual means: [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[printmaking]], [[sculpture]]\\n**Literature: [[poetry]], creative [[writing]]\\n*Performing arts\\n**Performing art including [[drama]] are (expression using the body: [[dance]], [[acting]], [[singing]])\\n**Auditory art (expression by making [[sound]]s): [[music]], [[singing]]\\n*Practical arts\\n** Culinary art (expression by making [[flavor]]s and [[taste]]s): [[cooking]] \\n** The practical arts (expression by making things and structures: [[architecture]], [[Movie|filming]], [[fashion]], [[photography]], [[video games]])\\n\\n== What \"art\" means ==\\nSome people say that art is a product or item that is made with the intention of stimulating the human senses as well as the [[mind|human mind]], [[spirit]] and [[soul]].  An artwork is normally judged by how much impact it has on people, the number of people who can relate to it, and how much they appreciate it.\\n\\nThe first and broadest sense of \"art\" means \"arrangement\" or \"to arrange.\" In this sense, art is created when someone arranges things found in the world into a new or different design or form; or when someone arranges colors next to each other in a painting to make an image or just to make a pretty or interesting design. \\n\\nArt may express [[emotion]].  Artists may feel a certain emotion and wish to express it by creating something that means something to them.  Most of the art created in this case is made for the artist rather than an [[audience]].  However, if an audience is able to connect with the emotion as well, then the art work may become publicly successful.\\n\\n== History of art ==\\n\\nThere are sculptures, [[cave painting]] and [[rock art]] dating from the Upper [[Paleolithic]] era.\\n\\nAll of the great ancient civilizations, such as Ancient [[Egypt]], [[India]], [[China]], [[Greece]], [[Rome]] or [[Arabia]] had works and styles of art. In the [[Middle Ages]], most of the art in [[Europe]] showed people from the [[Bible]] in [[painting]]s, [[stained glass]] windows, and [[mosaic]] tile floors and walls.\\n\\n[[Islamic]] art includes [[geometric]] patterns, Islamic [[calligraphy]], and [[architecture]]. In [[India]] and [[Tibet]], painted sculptures, dance, and religious painting were done. In China, arts included [[jade]] carving, bronzework, [[pottery]], [[poetry]], calligraphy, music, painting, drama, and fiction. There are many Chinese artistic styles, which are usually named after the ruling dynasty.\\n\\nIn Europe, after the [[Middle Ages]], there was a \"[[Renaissance]]\" which means \"rebirth\". People rediscovered [[science]] and artists were allowed to paint subjects other than religious subjects. People like [[Michelangelo]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] still painted religious pictures, but they also now could paint mythological pictures too. These artists also invented [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] where things in the distance look smaller than things close up in the picture. This was new because in the Middle Ages people would paint all the figures close up and just overlapping each other.\\n\\nIn the late 1800s, artists in Europe, responding to [[Industrialization|Modernity]] created many new painting styles such as [[Classicism]], [[Romanticism]], [[Realism]], and [[Impressionism]]. The history of twentieth century art includes [[Expressionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dada]]ism, [[Surrealism]], and [[Minimalism]].\\n\\n== Roles of art ==\\n\\nIn some [[society|societies]], people think that art belongs to the person who made it, such as Indigenous Aboriginal Australian Art. They think that the artist put his or her \"[[talent]]\" into the art. In this view, the art is the [[property]] of the artist.\\n\\nIn other societies, people think that art belongs to no one. They think that society has put its [[social capital]] into the artist and the artist\\'s work. In this view, society is a [[collective]] that has made the art, through the artist.\\n\\n=== Functions of art ===\\n\\nThe [[wikt:simple:function|functions]] of art include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bagdasaryan |first=Nadejda |title=Culturology |year=2000 |language=Russian |ISBN=5-06-003475-5 |pages=511 |chapter=7. Art as a phenomenon of culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\n1) Cognitive function\\n\\n:Works of art let us know about what the author knew, and about what the surrounding of the author were like.\\n\\n2) Aesthetic function\\n\\n:Works of art are more or less harmonic and bring pleasure, a sensation of beauty.\\n\\n3) Prognostic function\\n\\n:Some artists draw what they see the future like, and some of them are right, but most are not...\\n\\n4) Recreation function\\n\\n:Art makes us think about it, not about reality; we have a rest.\\n\\n5) Value function\\n\\n:What did the artist value? What aims did he like/dislike in human activity? This usually is clearly seen in artists\\' works.\\n\\n6) Didactic function\\n\\n:What message, criticism or political change did the artist wish to achieve?\\n\\n== Related pages ==\\n*[[Modern art]]\\n*[[Abstract art]]\\n*[[Painting]]\\n*[[Sculpture]]\\n*[[Street art]]\\n\\n== References ==\\n&lt;references/&gt;\\n\\n{{commonscat}}\\n\\n[[Category:Art| ]]\\n[[Category:Non-verbal communication]]\\n[[Category:Basic English 850 words]]</text>\\n      <sha1>1ho7anob92dx56qr51bix22mnc4fsbw</sha1>\\n    </revision>\\n  </page>\\n  <page>\\n    <title>A</title>\\n    <ns>0</ns>\\n    <id>8</id>\\n    <revision>\\n      <id>5757116</id>\\n      <parentid>5755799</parentid>\\n      <timestamp>2017-08-17T04:29:11Z</timestamp>\\n      <contributor>\\n        <ip>101.178.177.141</ip>\\n      </contributor>\\n      <model>wikitext</model>\\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\\n      <text xml:space=\"preserve\">{{more sources|date=February 2012}}\\n\\n: \\'\\'This page is about the first [[letter]] in the [[alphabet]].\\'\\'\\n: \\'\\'For the indefinite article, see [[Article (grammar)]].\\'\\'\\n: \\'\\'For other uses of A, see [[A (disambiguation)]]\\'\\'\\n\\n{{A-Z}}\\n[[File:A cursiva.gif|thumb]]\\n\\'\\'\\'A\\'\\'\\' is the first letter of the [[English language|English]] [[alphabet]]. The small letter, \\'\\'\\'a\\'\\'\\', is used as a lower case [[vowel]]. However, the English long \\'\\'\\'a\\'\\'\\' (&#257;) is said as a [[diphthong]] of &#277; and y. The same letter of the [[Greek alphabet]] is named [[alpha (letter)|alpha]]. Alpha and [[omega (letter)|omega]], the last letter of the Greek alphabet, means the beginning and the end. In [[musical notation]], the letter A is the symbol of a note in the scale, below [[B]] and above [[G]]. In [[binary]] numbers, the letter A is 01000001.\\n\\nA is the letter that was used to represent a team in an old [[TV]] show, [[The A-Team]]. A capital a is written \"A\".

The Greeks later modified this letter and used it as their letter [[Alpha (letter)|alpha]]. The Greek alphabet was used by the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] in northern Italy, and the Romans later modified the Etruscan alphabet for their own language.\\n\\n==Using the letter==\\nThe letter A has six different sounds. It can sound like &#230;, in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], such as the word \\'\\'pad\\'\\'. Other sounds of this letter are in the words \\'\\'father\\'\\', which developed into another sound, such as in the word \\'\\'ace\\'\\'.\\n\\n==Use in mathematics==\\nIn algebra, the letter \"A\" along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities.\\n\\nIn geometry, capital A, B, C etc. are used to label [[line segment]]s, [[Line (geomotry)|lines]], etc. Also, A is typically used as one of the letters to label an angle in a triangle.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{Reflist|refs=\\n&lt;ref name=\"Britannica\"&gt;\"A\", \"Encyclopaedia Britannica\", Volume 1, 1962. p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; \\n}}\\n\\n{{wikt}}\\n{{commonscat}}\\n\\n[[Category:Basic English 850 words]]\\n[[Category:Letters (alphabet)]]\\n[[Category:Vowel letters]]\\n\\n[[new:&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2367;&#2341;&#2367;&#2348;&#2368;]]</text>\\n      <sha1>66b58eptve7wa8trxv3sqsjoag1qsxm</sha1>\\n    </revision>\\n  </page>\\n  <page>\\n    <title>Air</title>\\n    <ns>0</ns>\\n    <id>9</id>\\n    <revision>\\n      <id>5711006</id>\\n      <parentid>5707238</parentid>\\n      <timestamp>2017-06-17T11:47:17Z</timestamp>\\n      <contributor>\\n        <username>Jim.henderson</username>\\n        <id>70336</id>\\n      </contributor>\\n      <comment>/* top */ [[aerobic respiration]]</comment>\\n      <model>wikitext</model>\\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\\n      <text xml:space=\"preserve\">{{dablink|Air is one of the four [[classical element]]s &#8211; \\'\\'\\'air\\'\\'\\', [[water]], [[earth]], and [[fire]]}}\\n[[Image:Air composition pie chart.JPG|thumb|240px|This is what the air is made of]]\\n[[Image:Kawasaki-Electric Fan.jpg|thumb|A [[wikt:fan|fan]] is used to move air]]\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Air\\'\\'\\' is the [[Earth]]\\'s [[atmosphere]].

It shows the site\\'s logo with a [[mop]], as administrators are often linked to [[janitor]]s.]]\\n\\'\\'\\'Administrators\\'\\'\\', also called \\'\\'\\'admins\\'\\'\\' or \\'\\'\\'sysops\\'\\'\\' (\\'\\'\\'sys\\'\\'\\'tem \\'\\'\\'op\\'\\'\\'erators), are users who can use special [[Special:ListGroupRights/Admin|tools]] that help keep Wikipedia running smoothly.  They can use these tools because they are trusted by the community, but this does not make them better or more important than anybody else.  The opinion of an administrator, for example, should not be counted as more important than the opinion of a person who chooses to change Wikipedia with an IP address just because they have administrator rights.\\n\\n\\'\\'There are currently {{NUMBEROFADMINS}} administrators.\\'\\'\\n\\n=== Administrative tools ===\\n==== Delete ====\\nThey can [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|delete]] and undelete pages. Pages can be deleted because of a [[WP:RFD|request for deletion]] or they can be [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Quick deletion|quickly deleted]] under policy. Undeletion requests should be made at [[Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion]].\\n\\n=====Revision Delete=====\\nAdministrators can also hide [[Help:Diff|revisions]] of a page from public view by deleting them. Only other administrators can see the deleted revisions. Revisions should only be hidden in special cases, listed [[Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Revision deletion|here]].\\n\\n==== Protect ====\\nThey can [[Wikipedia:Protection policy|protect]], unprotect and change protected pages, including those in the [[:en:Wikipedia:MediaWiki namespace|MediaWiki namespace]], and other users\\' personal [[Javascript]] or [[CSS]] (.js or .css) files.\\n* Requests for protection can be made at [[Wikipedia:Administrators\\' noticeboard]]. Please remember that pages are usually protected when there is [[WP:VAND|vandalism]] or an [[WP:edit war|edit war]] happening, and not to prevent vandalism that has not happened.\\n\\n==== Block ====\\nThey can [[Wikipedia:Blocks and bans|block]] and unblock users who are causing trouble.\\n* Requests should be made at [[Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress]] but only if the user has been disruptive.  Requests made in [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith|bad faith]] may result in you yourself being blocked. Blocks are different to bans.\\n\\n==== Rollback ====\\nThey can [[Wikipedia:Rollback|rollback changes]]. This lets them quickly undo all the changes by a user to a page if they are the newest changes. The change is automatically marked as a [[Help:small change|small change]] and gives the following [[WP:Change summary|change summary]]:\\n\\n:\\'\\'\\'m\\'\\'\\' \\'\\'Reverted edits by \\'\\'\\'User A\\'\\'\\' (\\'\\'\\'talk\\'\\'\\') to last version by \\'\\'\\'User B\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nTo use bot rollback, you type in the URL &lt;nowiki&gt;http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Example&amp;bot=1  &lt;/nowiki&gt; replacing Example with the user name, and then you can rollback changes and hide them from the recent changes along with the rolled back edit, but this should only be used for large amounts of vandalism, like with a [[:m:vandalbot|vandalbot]].\\n* Users can also be given the rollback tool. You can make requests at [[WP:RFRB|requests for rollback]].\\n\\n==== Import pages ====\\nThey can [[meta:Import|import]] pages from other Wikipedias.\\n\\n==== View unwatched pages ====\\nThey can see which pages are not on someone\\'s watchlist.\\n\\n==== Manage userrights ====\\nThey can give some user rights to others. They can add or remove rollback, IP block exempt, flooder, the uploader right, and the patroller right for all accounts.\\n\\n== Bureaucrat ==\\n{{shortcut|[[WP:CRAT]]&lt;br&gt;[[WP:BUR]]}}\\nA \\'\\'\\'bureaucrat\\'\\'\\' can do a few more things than an administrator, but they should only use these while acting on [[WP:CON|consensus]]. Bureaucrats can give administrator or bureaucrat rights to other users, following a successful request on [[Wikipedia:Requests for permissions]]. On the Simple English Wikipedia bureaucrats can also remove administrator status following a successful request for removal of rights (deadminship), or in certain emergency situations for protection of the wiki. They can also \"flag\" and un-flag [[Wikipedia:Bot|bots]], which means to hide their contributions from the new changes and put them in the bot group. Bureaucrats were previously able to help users who want to [[:meta:Changing username|change their username]]. These requests were handled on [[Wikipedia:Changing username]]. However, the ability to rename users has been removed from bureaucrats for [[:m:SUL finalization|SUL finalization]]. Now, these requests should be made at [[:m:SRUC|Meta-Wiki]] or on this [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|special page]] where stewards and global renamers will handle them.\\n\\n== CheckUser ==\\nA select few administrators have checkuser access. They can see the [[IP address]]es of named editors. They can also see which users edit from certain IP addresses, as well as some information on the [[browser]] used for editing. There are many rules as to who can become a CheckUser, and how CheckUsers have to behave. These rules are listed on the [[m:CheckUser policy|CheckUser policy]] page. CheckUsers can help fight [[vandalism]] and [[WP:Sock puppetry|sock puppetry]] this way. CheckUser requests can be made at [[Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser]].\\n\\n== Oversighter ==\\nCertain administrators have oversighter access. Page [[:en:Help:Diff|revisions]] can be hidden or removed from the public history so they can only be seen by other oversighters and [[:m:System administrators|developers]]. The right is a sensitive one, and removes private data that can cause legal problems. There are many rules as to who can become an oversighter, and how oversighters have to behave. These rules are listed on the [[m:Oversight|Oversighter policy]] page. Oversighters can help fight [[wp:VAN|vandalism]] this way.

These are similar, but NOT the same, to states in the [[United States]] of America, for example.\\n\\nSpain has fifty smaller parts called provinces. In [[1978]] these parts came together, making the autonomous communities. \\nBefore then, some of these provinces were together but were broken. The groups that were together once before are called \"historic communities\": Catalonia, Basque Country, Galicia and Andalusia.\\n\\nThe Spanish language is the sole official language in every autonomous community but six, where Spanish is co-official with other languages, as follows:\\n* [[Catalonia]]: [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Occitan language|Occitan]]\\n* [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencian Community]]: [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (also called [[Valencian language|Valencian]] there)\\n* [[Balearic Islands]]: [[Catalan language|Catalan]]\\n* [[Galicia]]: [[Galician language|Galician]]\\n* [[:en:Basque_Country|Basque Country]]: [[Basque language|Basque]]\\n* [[Navarre]]: [[basque language|Basque]] (only in the north and near the border with the Basque County)\\n\\nList of the autonomous communities, with their Capital city (the place where the government has its offices):\\n\\n* [[Andalusia]] (its capital is [[Sevilla]])\\n* [[Aragon]] (its capital is [[Zaragoza]])\\n* [[Asturias]] (its capital is [[Oviedo]])\\n* [[Balearic Islands]] (its capital is [[Palma de Mallorca]])\\n* [[:en:Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] (its capital is [[Vitoria]])\\n* [[Canary Islands]] (they have two capitals - [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] and [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]])\\n* [[Cantabria]] (its capital is [[Santander, Spain|Santander]])\\n* [[Castile-La Mancha]] (its capital is [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]])\\n* [[Castile and Le&#243;n]] (its capital is [[Valladolid]])\\n* [[Catalonia]] (its capital is [[Barcelona]])\\n* [[Extremadura]] (its capital is [[M&#233;rida]])\\n* [[Galicia]] (its capital is [[Santiago de Compostela]])\\n* [[La Rioja]] (its capital is [[Logro&#241;o]])\\n* [[Community of Madrid]] (its capital is [[Madrid]])\\n* [[Region of Murcia]] (its capital is [[Murcia]])\\n* [[Navarre]] (its capital is [[Pamplona]])\\n* [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencian Community]] (its capital is [[Valencia]])\\n\\nSpain also has two cities on the north coast of Africa: [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]].

He was born in [[Maida Vale]], London.&lt;ref&gt;Newman M.H.A. 1955. Alan Mathison Turing. 1912&#8211;1954. \\'\\'Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society\\'\\' \\'\\'\\'1\\'\\'\\': 253. [http://rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/253]&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\n== Young Life and Family ==\\nAlan Turing was born in Maida Vale, London. His father was part of a family of [[Merchant|merchants]] from Scotland. His mother, Ethel Sara, was the [[daughter]] of an [[engineer]].\\n\\n=== Education ===\\nTuring went to St. Michael\\'s, a school at 20 Charles Road, St Leonards-on-sea, when he was six years old.\\n\\n== Career ==\\nTuring was one of the people who worked on the first [[computers]]. He was the first person to think of using a computer to do things that were too hard for a person to do. He created the [[Turing machine]] in 1936. The machine was [[Imagination|imaginary]], but it included the idea of a [[computer program]]. \\n\\nTuring was interested in [[artificial intelligence]]. He proposed the [[Turing test]], to say when a machine could be called \"[[Intelligence|intelligent]]\". A computer could be said to \"think\" if a human talking with it could not tell it was a machine.&lt;ref&gt;Harnad, Stevan 2008.  [http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/7741 The Annotation game: Turing (1950) on Computing, machinery and intelligence]. In: Epstein, Robert &amp; Peters, Grace (eds) \\'\\'Parsing the Turing Test: philosophical and methodological issues in the quest for the thinking computer\\'\\'. Springer&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\nDuring [[World War II]], Turing worked to break [[Germany|German]] [[cipher]]s (secret messages). Using [[cryptanalysis]], he helped to break the codes of the [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] machine. After that, he solved other German codes.\\n\\nFrom 1945 to 1947, Turing worked on the design of the [[ACE (computer)|ACE]] (Automatic Computing Engine) at the [[National Physical Laboratory]]. He presented a paper on 19 February 1946. That paper was \"the first detailed design of a [[stored-program computer]]\".&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, B. Jack 2006. \\'\\'Colossus: The secrets of Bletchley Park\\'s code-breaking computers\\'\\'. Oxford University Press. p108 ISBN 978-0-19-284055-4&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was possible to build ACE, there were delays in starting the project. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year. While he was at Cambridge, the [[Pilot ACE]] was built without him. It ran its first program on 10&amp;nbsp;May 1950.\\n\\n== Private life ==\\nTuring was a [[homosexual]] man. In 1952, he admitted having had sex with a man in [[England]]. At that time, [[homosexual]] acts were illegal. Turing was [[conviction|convicted]]. He had to choose between going to [[jail]] and taking [[hormone]]s to lower his sex drive. He decided to take the hormones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Letters of Note: Yours in distress, Alan |last=Turing |first=Alan |year=1952 |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/yours-in-distress-alan.html |archivedate=December 16, 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CxLiSeL9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his punishment, he became [[erectile dysfunction|impotent]].

The cyanide came from either an [[apple]] which was poisoned with [[cyanide]], or from water that had cyanide in it. The reason for the confusion is that the police never tested the apple for cyanide.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, Andrew 1983. \\'\\'Alan Turing: the enigma\\'\\'. London: Burnett Books, p488. ISBN 0-04-510060-8&lt;/ref&gt;It is also suspected that he committed suicide. \\n\\nThe treatment forced on him is now believed to be very wrong. It is against [[medical ethics]] and international laws of [[human rights]]. In August 2009, a [[petition]] asking the [[British Government]] to apologise to Turing for punishing him for being a homosexual was started.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thousands call for Turing apology |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8226509.stm |publisher=BBC News  |date=31&amp;nbsp;August 2009 |accessdate=31 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Petition seeks apology for Enigma code-breaker Turing | url = http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/09/01/alan.turing.petition/index.html | publisher=CNN | date = 01&amp;nbsp;September 2009 | accessdate =1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition received thousands of signatures.&lt;ref&gt;The petition was only open to UK citizens.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] acknowledged the petition.

Farming is a part of [[agriculture]].\\n\\n== History ==\\nAgriculture started thousands of years ago, but no one knows for sure how old it is.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Tudge argues \"from at least 40,000 years ago... people were managing their environment to such an extent that they can properly be called \\'proto-farmers\\'\". Tudge, Colin 1998. \\'\\'Neanderthals, bandits and farmers: how agriculture really began\\'\\'. London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, p3. ISBN 0-297-84258-7&lt;/ref&gt; The development of farming gave rise to the [[Neolithic Revolution]] whereby people gave up [[nomad]]ic [[hunting]] and became [[settler]]s in what became [[cities]].\\n\\nAgriculture and [[domestication]] probably started in the [[Fertile Crescent]] (the [[Nile]] Valley, The [[Levant]] and [[Mesopotamia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Harris, David (ed) 1996. \\'\\'The origins and spread of agriculture and pastoralism in [[Eurasia]]: crops, fields, flocks and herds\\'\\'. University College London Press. ISBN 1-56098-675-1&lt;/ref&gt; The area called Fertile Crescent is now in the countries of [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Turkey]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], and [[Egypt]]. [[Wheat]] and [[barley]] are some of the first crops people grew. People probably started agriculture slowly by planting a few crops, but still gathered many foods from the wild. People may have started farming because the weather and soil began to change. Farming can feed many more people than [[hunter-gatherer]]s can feed on the same amount of land.\\n\\n== Kinds of farming ==\\nAgriculture is not only growing food for people and animals, but also growing other things like [[flower]]s and [[nursery]] [[plant]]s, manure or dung, [[animal hides]] (skins or furs), [[leather]], animals, fungi, [[fiber]]s ([[cotton]], [[wool]], [[hemp]], and [[flax]]), [[biofuel]]s , and [[drug]]s (bio[[pharmaceuticals]], [[marijuana]], [[opium]]).\\n\\nMany people still live by [[subsistence agriculture]], on a small farm.  They can only grow enough food to feed the farmer, his family, and his animals.  Extra food or animals are sold for money or other things the farmer cannot grow. The [[yield]] is the amount of food grown on a given amount of land, and it is often low. This is because subsistence farmers are generally less [[education|educated]], and they have less [[money]] to buy equipment. [[Drought]] and other problems sometimes cause [[famine]]s.  Where yields are low, [[deforestation]] can provide new land to grow more food.  This provides more [[nutrition]] for the farmer\\'s family, but can be bad for the country and the surrounding [[environment]] over many years.\\n\\nIn rich countries, farms are often fewer and larger.  During the 20th century they have become more productive because farmers are able to grow better [[variety (botany)|varieties]] of plants, use more fertilizer, use more water, and more easily control weeds and pests.  Many farms also use machines, so fewer people can farm more land.  There are fewer farmers in rich countries, but the farmers are able to grow more. \\n\\nThis kind of [[intensive agriculture]] comes with its own set of problems. Farmers use a lot of chemical fertilizers, [[pesticide]]s (chemicals that kill bugs), and [[herbicide]]s (chemicals that kill weeds). These chemicals can [[pollute]] the [[soil]] or the water. They can also create bugs and weeds that are more resistant to the chemicals, causing outbreaks of these pests. The soil can be damaged by [[erosion]] (blowing or washing away), salt buildup, or loss of structure. [[Irrigation]] (adding water from rivers) can pollute water and lower the water table. These problems have all got solutions, and modern young farmers usually have a good technical education.\\n\\n=== Agriculture techniques ===\\n* [[Fertilizer]]s\\n* [[Crop rotation]]\\n* [[Weed]] removal\\n* [[Breeding]]\\n* [[Agricultural fencing|Fencing]]\\n* [[Ranching]]\\n* [[Plantation]]\\n\\nFarmers select plants with better yield, taste, and [[nutrition]]al value.  They also choose plants that can survive [[plant disease]] and drought, and are easier to harvest.  Centuries of [[artificial selection]] and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. The crops produce better yield with other techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, irrigation).\\n\\nSome companies have been searching for new plants in poor countries, and genetically modify these plants to improve them. They then try to patent the seeds and sell them back to the poor countries.\\n\\nNew plants were created with [[genetic engineering]]. One example of [[genetic engineering]] is modifying a plant to resist a herbicide.\\n\\n== Food ==\\nIt is important for there to be enough food for everyone. The food must also be safe and good. People say it is not always safe, because it contains some chemicals. Other people say intensive agriculture is damaging the environment. For this reason, there are several types of agriculture.\\n* Traditional agriculture is mostly done in poor countries.\\n* Intensive agriculture is mostly done in countries with more money. It uses pesticides, machinery, chemical fertilizers. \\n* Organic farming is using only natural products such as compost and green manure. \\n* Integrated farming is using local resources, and trying to use the waste from one process as a resource in another process.\\n\\n[[Agricultural policy]] focuses on the goals and methods of agricultural production. At the policy level, common goals of agriculture include:\\n\\n* [[Food safety]]: to be sure that the food supply is safe.\\n* [[Food security]]: to be sure there is enough food for everyone.\\n* [[Food quality]]: to be sure the food is of good quality.\\n\\n== Problems in agriculture ==\\nThere are some serious problems that people face trying to grow food today.\\nThese include:\\n* [[Erosion]]\\n* [[Diseases]]\\n* [[Pests]]\\n* [[Weed]]s\\n* [[Drought]]\\n* [[Rainfall]]\\n\\n== Crops ==\\nThe major crops produced in the world in 2002, are maize (corn), wheat, rice, and cotton.\\n\\n*[[Maize]] 624 millions of metric tons\\n*[[Wheat]] 570 millions of metric tons\\n*[[Rice]] 381.1 millions of metric tons\\n*[[Cotton]] 96.5 millions of metric tons\\n\\n\\'\\'See also\\'\\': [[List of vegetables]], [[List of herbs]], [[List of fruit]]\\n\\n== Related pages ==\\n{{Commons category|Agriculture|Farming}}\\n* [[Aquaculture]]\\n* [[Bee keeping]]\\n* [[Animal husbandry]]\\n\\n== References ==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n[[Category:Agriculture| ]]</text>\\n      <sha1>igx40viivfeeipdeessnzp4h43807dr</sha1>\\n    </revision>\\n  </page>\\n  <page>\\n    <title>User talk:Anthere</title>\\n    <ns>3</ns>\\n    <id>20</id>\\n    <revision>\\n      <id>36376</id>\\n      <parentid>3396</parentid>\\n      <timestamp>2004-02-11T05:46:03Z</timestamp>\\n      <contributor>\\n        <username>Menchi</username>\\n        <id>3</id>\\n      </contributor>\\n      <minor></minor>\\n      <comment>Reverted to last edit by Anthere</comment>\\n      <model>wikitext</model>\\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\\n      <text xml:space=\"preserve\">Input on [[Simple English Wikipedia policy]] requested.

They all say \"oh it must be kept\", \"it can be improved\", \"you can do this with it\", \"merge it somewhere else\" but none of them ever do this. They just want to vote - they don\\'t want to help improve those articles. They think they can just sit in VfD and tell someone else to do the work. All some people do is sit in VfD or sit in the mailing lists complaining. They never even write articles or help to improve existing ones.

People get angry at me and I didn\\'t even notice there was an edit war and I didn\\'t think I was in one! Some people see things in a very funny way. [[Angela]]\\n\\nLOL. I went over the history of the past pages we shared, and I think it is over [[fr:&#233;cologiste]], though I am not sure. Look at the history http://fr.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=%C9cologiste&amp;action=history\\n\\ndoes that look like an edit war ?\\n\\nlook at the discussion page\\nhttp://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discuter%3A%C9cologiste\\n\\ndoes that look like an edit war ?\\n\\nI mentionned in the talk page that his current paragraph was perhaps a bit err... strong... and required eventually a citation or an example\\n\\nHe wrote\\n\\nThe [[ethic]] of \\'\\'ecologists\\'\\' is often assailed (or onslaughted ?) by their detractors who see only [[hystery]] there.  Among the most virulent are the industrials, the civil actors of [[nuclear energy appear]], the military, farmers practicing [[intensive agriculture|intensive]] and even [[integrated agriculture]] as well, [[chemical industry]] increasingly oriented toward [[genetic engineering]], [[seed industry]], and [[hunter]]s.\\n\\nI merely said that \"onslaughted\" (he used a very very very hard term) was perhaps not very npov, that an example would be fine (not that it should be hard to found), that citing those doing integrated agriculture was perhaps going a bit far, that chemical industry had little to do directly with genetic engineering, and that perhaps citing such a long list was curious if those listed were said the *most* virulent. So, I just suggested rephrasing, examples and citations.\\n\\nSo, he removed his paragraph (one of mine in the process, which I put back) and is now claiming we are in major war, that he is very upset because the topic is very important to him and that of course no one could have missed our major disagreement. Oie, if it is so important to him he can\\'t bear a tiny criticism, he better quit. What would he say if I were treating him like RK is treating the ones he disagrees with :-)))) I don\\'t think either anyone noticed a pb, and that anyone has the slightest beginning of the idea where the conflict is :-)\\n\\nI fail to see what to do really :-(\\n\\nYou know, Wikipedia is really a weird place :-) We are major paranoid people :-)\\n\\nthanks for the improvment to sheep. That was perfect.\\n\\n:That does not look like an edit war at all. You were only adding information, not taking anything away. He is complaining about nothing IMO. \\n\\n:I just read the discussion of interlanguage links at fr and how Traroth wants the links on separate lines. This hasn\\'t really been discussed at en but Kricxjo told him not to do this (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User%20talk:Traroth). Will you tell me if anything is decided about it please? Also, have you seen [http://meta.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poor_language_skills poor language skills] at Meta. You might want to say something there. Does what I wrote on my [http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilisateur:Angela user page] at fr make sense? I think it should be \"ma page de discussion\" not \"ma page de discuter\". Is anything else wrong? I would really appreciate if you could tell me or fix it for me :). Thank you. [[Angela]]\\n\\n::there was an extended discussion on fr about placement of links, and spaces between each item. Generally speaking, Traroth was outvoted. He commited the mistake to shout after Orthogaffe, our bot, because this one \"reverted\" Traroth position work :-) I do not think any thing was really changed in the end. He was told he could do the way he wanted, but not complain that others did differently :-)\\n\\n::I showered my problematic one with compliment and offered him new food for thought. Non controversial :-) He seemed more quiet today.  I talked to another about him by email, asking opinion, but this latter chose not to answer on this point. Hum...I\\'ll see how it develops. I am walking on eggs.\\n\\n-------\\n\\nHi, Anthere. I have a question for you. It seems to me that you are an [[English As A Second Language]] (or third or fourth :-) ) user, but not really a [[Simple English]] user. I.e., your English is pretty good. What do you think about this? -- RJ092191.user.veloxzone.com.br \\n\\n\\n:ESL : English As A Second Language. Okay, right. Does this place has a Jargon ? If not, it should.\\n\\n:I do not think I am a simple english user. I understand most regular english articles. I do not understand them well when they are specialised in topics I know little about, and only secondary when they use too much jargon. I can guess jargon in topics I know. There are some topics I now feel more confortable with in english, because I know the english jargon, but not the french :-)))\\n\\n:So I would not be a user of this place.\\n\\n:However, reading, understanding and writing are three different things. I can write poor english rather quickly. Not so quickly to provide better english. On en: I mostly create new articles on specialised topics, when I see noone else is doing so - a bad article is better than none. I sometimes add to already developped topics, but not often as I fear being said I spoil an article. I extremely rarely refactor other people writing. Some say ESL people should not write simple as it requires very good english to be able to write in simple english. I think I could write in simple english, but am having problems to write simple content. So, I am a full-english user, I am not a simple english user, I am a semi-editor on simple and full english, and generally speaking a full pain :-)\\n\\n:I could be a german simple user :-)\\n\\n:do you speak other languages ?\\n----\\n\\nI don\\'t know of any list. I think new languages could now start straight into phase III. There isn\\'t a reason to use this old software anymore.\\n\\n:was asked...but not done :-(\\n\\nI don\\'t think you can do things like check for \"lonely pages\".\\n\\n:don\\'t remember this feature either\\n\\nTheer aren\\'t really any special features like that here. You can\\'t list the users or whatever.\\n\\n:of course since we are pages. I don\\'t even remember the command for all pages :-(\\n\\n::[http://simple.wikipedia.com/wiki.cgi?action=index All pages]\\n\\nYou can see what to a page by clicking the title though. I think that is the only special feature.\\n\\nYou are right about images - they are just links.\\n\\nYou can\\'t really have admins like you can on phase II or III. I think you need to get a password from Jimbo which then lets you delete and move pages.\\n\\n:tse tse, I was admin on fr for a good while on phase I. I could delete (permanent deletion), move pages, and block user and ip. It was a pain to do. I told the guy Jimbo would probably refuse it at first, because no one know him, and because he would be alone. Hum.\\n\\n[[Angela]]\\n\\n:thanks. It is too bad the way it works was listed no where. \\n\\n::It is but hopefully the old software will all be changed soon so it won\\'t matter.\\n\\n:btw, Looxix wrote me to ask me what was going on about the pb I talked to you about. I feel less stupid seeing that others noticed the problem, and do not understand better :-(\\n\\n::Good. I\\'m glad you\\'re not alone in it.

It is a part of [[mathematics]]. The four basic arithmetic operations are [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], and [[Division (mathematics)|division]].\\n\\nHarder arithmetic includes working with [[signed number]]s, [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]], and [[decimal]]s, and taking [[power (math)|powers]] and [[root (math)|roots]].\\n\\nMost people learn arithmetic in [[primary school]], but some people do not learn arithmetic and others forget the arithmetic they learned. Many jobs require a knowledge of arithmetic, and many employers complain that it is hard to find people who know enough arithmetic. A few of the many jobs that require arithmetic include [[carpenter]]s, [[plumber]]s, [[automobile mechanic|auto mechanics]], [[accountant]]s, [[architect]]s, [[Medical doctor|doctors]], and [[nurse]]s. Arithmetic is needed in all areas of mathematics, [[science]], and [[engineering]]. \\n\\nA [[calculator]] can be used to do arithmetic. [[Computer]]s can do it more quickly, which is one reason [[Global Positioning System]] receivers have a small computer inside. \\n\\n== Examples of arithmetic ==\\n\\n* 2 + 3 = 5 (adding is [[commutative property|commutative]]: 2 + 3 is the same as 3 + 2)\\n\\n* 7 - 5 = 2 (subtracting is not commutative: 7 - 5 is different from 5 - 7)\\n\\n* 3 * 4 = 12 (multiplying is commutative: 3 * 4 is the same as 4 * 3)\\n\\n* 6 / 2 = 3 (dividing is not commutative: 6 / 2 is different from 2 / 6)\\n\\n\\n{{Math-stub}}\\n\\n\\n[[Category:Arithmetics]]</text>\\n      <sha1>t8g0oiz89kbu7sph15jqevfxnlxh97a</sha1>\\n    </revision>\\n  </page>\\n  <page>\\n    <title>Addition</title>\\n    <ns>0</ns>\\n    <id>22</id>\\n    <revision>\\n      <id>5734648</id>\\n      <parentid>5734627</parentid>\\n      <timestamp>2017-07-14T12:07:19Z</timestamp>\\n      <contributor>\\n        <username>Djsasso</username>\\n        <id>18539</id>\\n      </contributor>\\n      <minor></minor>\\n      <comment>[[Help:Revert a page|Reverted]] edits by [[Special:Contributions/83.24.95.61|83.24.95.61]] ([[User talk:83.24.95.61|talk]]) to last version by Only</comment>\\n      <model>wikitext</model>\\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\\n      <text xml:space=\"preserve\">{{redirect|Add|other articles with the same name|ADD (disambiguation)}}\\n[[Image:Addition.gif|thumb|220px|Addition ]]\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Addition\\'\\'\\' is the [[mathematics|mathematical]] way of putting things together.\\n\\n== Arithmetic ==\\n\\nIn [[arithmetic]], addition is finding the total of two or more [[number]]s. The sign for addition is \"+\". The name for the sign \"+\" is \"plus\".  \\nAnother name for the total is the [[sum]].\\n\\n=== Counting examples ===\\nFor example, there are [[wikt:object|objects]] in two [[group]]s. The objects are small circles: \"o\". One group has five of these objects. The other group has 3 of these objects. To find the total number of objects in both groups, the objects can be counted. Another way to find the number of objects in both groups is to add the numbers in each group.  \\n\\n====Adding====\\n\\nAnother method is to add the numbers of objects in group A and group B, since they are already counted. In symbols:\\n\\n:{{math|5 + 3}}\\n\\nThere are [[rule]]s for adding numbers that people [[learn]]. There are also rules for adding numbers that are built into machines ([[binary adder]]). The rule says that:\\n\\n:{{math|{{aao|5|3|+}}}}\\n\\nIn another counting example, Sally and Bill have 2 children. Sally and Bill get 3 more children. Sally and Bill have added three children to their two children and now have five children.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Vertical Addition\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nThe animation above demonstrates the addition of seven hundred and eighty six and four hundred and sixty seven, the problems digits have been separated into units, tens and hundreds ([[place value]]).  First the units 6 and 7 are added together to make 13, so 1 ten and 3 units, the 3 is written below and the 1 ten is carried to the tens column. Next in the tens column the 1, 8 and 6 are added together to make 15 tens, so 1 hundred and 5 tens, the 5 is written below and the 1 hundred is carried to the hundreds column. Finally in the hundreds column 1, 7 and 4 are added together to make 12 hundreds, so 1 thousand and 2 hundreds, the 2 is written below and the 1 thousand is carried to the thousand column. Giving the answer one thousand two hundred and fifty three.\\n\\n===A measurement example===\\nTom wants to know the distance between his house and Sally\\'s house. Bob\\'s house is 300 meters  east of Tom\\'s house. Sally\\'s house is 120 meters east of Bob\\'s house:\\n\\n:Tom\\'s house&lt;------------300 meters--------------&gt;Bob\\'s house&lt;-----120 meters-----&gt;Sally\\'s house\\n\\nThe distance from Tom\\'s house to Sally\\'s house can be found by adding the distances already measured. The distance from Tom\\'s house to Bob\\'s house added to the distance from Bob\\'s house to Sally\\'s house is the same as the distance from Tom\\'s house to Sally\\'s house. That is, three hundred (300) meters plus 120 meters.\\n:{{math|{{aao|300|120|+}}}}\\n\\n== Addition as increase ==\\nAddition can also mean to make bigger.\\n\\n=== Example of addition as increase ===\\n* For example, Tom has a house. Tom puts a new room on the house. This new room is called an addition.\\n\\n* John is making [[food]]. To make the food [[taste]] better, John puts [[salt]] in the food. That is, John adds salt to the food. The [[salt]] is a [[food additive]] or addition to the food.\\n\\n==Addition table==\\n{{Addition table}}\\n\\n== Other websites ==\\n* [http://www.aaamath.com/add.html AAA Math web page on teaching addition]\\n* [http://www.aplusmath.com/Flashcards/addition.html addition flashcard website]\\n* [http://www.dositey.com/addsub/addition.htm Addition facts and games]\\n\\n[[Category:Basic English 850 words]]\\n[[Category:Arithmetics]]\\n[[Category:Hyperoperations]]\\n{{wikt}}</text>\\n      <sha1>c5rwd576k90gj73a70b9lcf2bg1dunj</sha1>\\n    </revision>\\n  </page>\\n  <page>\\n    <title>Albigensian</title>\\n    <ns>0</ns>\\n    <id>24</id>\\n    <redirect title=\"Catharism\"></redirect>\\n    <revision>\\n      <id>973365</id>\\n      <parentid>36379</parentid>\\n      <timestamp>2008-07-19T17:11:13Z</timestamp>\\n      <contributor>\\n        <username>&#12479;&#12481;&#12467;&#12510; robot</username>\\n        <id>11594</id>\\n      </contributor>\\n      <minor></minor>\\n      <comment>Robot: Fixing double redirect</comment>\\n      <model>wikitext</model>\\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\\n      <text xml:space=\"preserve\">#REDIRECT [[Catharism]]</text>\\n      <sha1>8pqvcracmfabxz3mb0j123ar2wq4ww7</sha1>\\n    </revision>\\n  </page>\\n  <page>\\n    <title>Australia</title>\\n    <ns>0</ns>\\n    <id>27</id>\\n    <revision>\\n      <id>5753851</id>\\n      <parentid>5753850</parentid>\\n      <timestamp>2017-08-11T23:36:22Z</timestamp>\\n      <contributor>\\n        <username>Zhangj1079</username>\\n        <id>595018</id>\\n      </contributor>\\n      <minor></minor>\\n      <comment>Reverted 2 edits by [[Special:Contributions/Bibliophilic Edits|Bibliophilic Edits]] ([[User talk:Bibliophilic Edits|talk]]) identified as [[WP:VAND|vandalism]] to last revision by Paigem15.

Because of this, many [[animals]] and [[plants]] live in Australia that do not live anywhere else. These include animals like the [[kangaroo]], the [[koala]], the [[emu]], the [[kookaburra]], and the [[platypus]].\\n\\nPeople first arrived in Australia more than 50,000 years ago. These native Australians are called the [[Australian Aborigine]]s. For the history of Australia, see [[History of Australia]].\\n\\nMost of the Australian colonies, having been settled from [[Britain]], became mostly independent democratic states in the 1850s and all six combined as a federation on 1 January 1901. The first [[Prime Minister of Australia]] was [[Edmund Barton]] in 1901. Australia is a member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. It is a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] with [[Queen Elizabeth II|Elizabeth II]] as Queen of Australia and Head of State and a [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] who is chosen by the Prime Minister to carry out all the duties of the Queen in Australia.\\n\\n=== Regions and cities ===\\n{{Other pages|List of Cities in Australia}}\\nAustralia has six states, two major mainland territories, and other minor territories.

They lived in all sorts of climates and managed the land in different ways. An example of Aboriginal land management was the [[Cumberland Plain]] where Sydney is now. Every few years the Aboriginal people would burn the grass and small trees.{{Citation}} This meant that a lot of grass grew back, but not many big trees. Kangaroos like to live on grassy plains, but not in forests. The kangaroos that lived on the plain were a good food supply for the Aboriginal people. Sometimes, Aborigines would name a person after an animal, and they could not eat that animal to help level out the food population.\\n\\nAboriginal people did not usually build houses, except huts of grass, leaves and bark. They did not usually build walls or fences, and there were no horses, cows or sheep in Australia that needed to be kept in pens. The only Aboriginal buildings that are known are fish-traps made from stones piled up in the river, and the remains of a few stone huts in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]].{{Citation}} The Aboriginal people did not use metal or make pottery or use bows and arrows or weave cloth. In some parts of Australia the people used sharp flaked-stone spearheads, but most Aboriginal spears were made of sharply pointed wood. Australia has a lot of trees that have very hard wood that was good for spear making. The [[boomerang]] was used in some areas for sport and for hunting.\\n\\nThe Aboriginal people did not think that the land belonged to them. They believed that they had grown from the land, so it was like their mother, and they belonged to the land.\\n\\n=== Terra Australis ===\\nIn the 1600s, [[Dutch people|Dutch]] merchants traded with the islands of [[Batavia]] (now [[Indonesia]]), to the north of Australia and several different Dutch ships touched on the coast of Australia. The Dutch governor, van Diemen, sent [[Abel Tasman]] on a voyage of discovery and he found [[Tasmania]], which he named [[Van Diemen\\'s Land]]. Its name was later changed to honour the man who discovered it.\\n\\nThe [[British Government]] was sure that there must be a very large land in the south, that had not been explored. They sent Captain [[James Cook]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. His ship, \\'\\'[[HMS Endeavour]]\\'\\', carried the famous scientists, Sir [[Joseph Banks]] and Dr Solander who were going to [[Tahiti]] where they would watch the planet [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] pass in front of the [[Sun]]. Captain Cook\\'s secret mission was to find \"[[Terra Australis]]\" (the Land of the South).\\n\\nThe voyage of discovery was very successful, because they found [[New Zealand]] and sailed right around it. Then they sailed westward. At last, a boy, William Hicks, who was up the mast spotted land on the [[horizon]]. Captain Cook named that bit of land [[Point Hicks]]. They sailed up the coast and Captain Cook named the land that he saw \"New South Wales\". At last they sailed into a large open bay which was full of fish and stingrays which the sailors speared for food. Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander went ashore and were astonished to find that they did not know what any of the plants or birds or animals that they saw were. They collected hundreds of plants to take back to England.\\n\\nCaptain Cook saw the Aboriginal people with their simple way of life. He saw them fishing and hunting and collecting grass seeds and fruit. But there were no houses and no fences. In most parts of the world, people put up a house and a fence or some marker to show that they own the land. But the Aboriginal people did not own the land in that way. They belonged to the land, like a baby belongs to its mother. Captain Cook went home to England and told the government that no-one owned the land. This would later cause a terrible problem for the Aboriginal people.\\n\\n=== Settlement ===\\n[[File:The Founding of Australia. By Capt. Arthur Phillip R.N. Sydney Cove, Jan. 26th 1788.jpg|thumb|Captain [[Arthur Phillip]] raises the British flag at [[Sydney]] in 1788.]]\\n\\nIn the 1700s, in England, laws were tough, many people were poor and [[gaol]]s ([[jail]]s) were full. A person could be sentenced to death for stealing a loaf of bread. Many people were hung for small crimes. But usually they were just thrown in gaol. Often they were sent away to the British colonies in America. But by the 1770s, the colonies in America became the United States. They were free from British rule and would not take England\\'s convicts any more, so England needed to find a new and less populated place.\\n\\nBy the 1780s the gaols of England were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships. The government decided to make a settlement in New South Wales and send some of the convicts there. In 1788 the [[First Fleet]] of eleven ships set sail from [[Portsmouth]] carrying convicts, sailors, marines, a few free settlers and enough food to last for two years. Their leader was Captain [[Arthur Phillip]]. They were to make a new colony at the place that Captain Cook had discovered, named Botany Bay because of all the unknown plants found there by the two scientists.\\n\\nCaptain Phillip found that [[Botany Bay]] was flat and windy. There was not much fresh water. He went with two ships up the coast and sailed into a great harbor which he said was \"the finest harbor in the world!\" There were many small bays on the harbor so he decided on one which had a good stream of fresh water and some flat shore to land on. On 26 January 1788, the flag was raised and New South Wales was claimed in the name of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] of England, and the new settlement was called Sydney.\\n\\nFor the first few years of the settlement, things were very difficult. No-one in the British Government had thought very hard about what sort of convicts should be sent to make a new colony. Nobody had chosen them carefully. There was only one man who was a farmer. There was no-one among the convicts who was a builder, a brick-maker or a blacksmith. No-one knew how to fix the tools when they broke. All of the cattle escaped. There were no cooking pots. All the plants were different so no-one knew which ones could be eaten. It was probable that everyone in the new colony would die of starvation.\\n\\nSomehow, the little group of tents with a hut for the Governor, Arthur Phillip, and another hut for the supply of food, grew into a small town with streets, a bridge over the stream, a windmill for grinding grain and wharves for ships. By the 1820s there was a fine brick house for the Governor. There was also a hospital and a convict barracks and a beautiful church which are still standing today. Settlements had spread out from Sydney, firstly to [[Norfolk Island]] and to [[Van Diemen\\'s Land]] (Tasmania), and also up the coast to Newcastle, where coal was discovered, and inland where the missing cattle were found to have grown to a large herd. Spanish Merino sheep had been brought to Sydney, and by 1820, farmers were raising fat lambs for meat and also sending fine wool back to the factories of England.\\n\\nWhile the settlement was growing in New South Wales, it was also growing in Tasmania. The climate in Tasmania was more like that in England, and farmers found it easy to grow crops there.\\n\\n=== Exploration ===\\n[[File:Ln-Governor-Lachlan macquarie.jpg|thumb|Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] was the 5th [[governor of New South Wales]] and one who though that Australia could be a rich and free place.]]\\n\\nBecause Australia is such a very large land, it was easy to think that it might be able to hold a very large number of people. In the early days of the colony, a great number of explorers went out, searching for good land to settle on.\\nWhen the settlers looked west from Sydney, they saw a range of mountains which they called the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]]. They were not very high and did not look very rugged but for many years no-one could find their way through them. In 1813 [[Gregory Blaxland]], [[William Lawson (explorer)|William Lawson]] and a 17-year-old called [[William Charles Wentworth]] crossed the Blue Mountains and found land on the other side which was good for farming. A road was built and the governor, [[Lachlan Macquarie]] founded the town of [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] on the other side, 100&amp;nbsp;miles from Sydney.\\n\\nSome people, like Captain [[Charles Sturt]] were sure that there must be a sea in the middle of Australia and set out to find it. Many of the explorers did not prepare very well, or else they went out to explore at the hottest time of year. Some died like Burke and Wills. [[Ludwig Leichhardt]] got lost twice. The second time, he was never seen again. Major [[Thomas Mitchell]] was one of the most successful explorers. He mapped the country as he went, and his maps remained in use for more than 100 years. He travelled all the way to what is now western Victoria, and to his surprise and annoyance found that he was not the first white person there. The [[Henty Brothers|Henty brothers]] had come from [[Tasmania]], had built themselves a house, had a successful farm and fed the Major and his men on roast lamb and wine.\\n\\n===Self government===\\n\\nThe gold rushes of New South Wales and Victoria started in 1851 leading to large numbers of people arriving to search for gold. The population grew across south east Australia and made great wealth and industry. By 1853 the gold rushes had made some poor people, very rich.\\n\\nThe transportation of convicts to Australia ended in the 1840s and 1850s and more changes came. The people in Australia wanted to run their own country, and not be told what to do from London. The first governments in the colonies were run by governors chosen by London. Soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy. [[William Wentworth]] started the Australian Patriotic Association (Australia\\'s first political party) in 1835 to demand [[Parliamentary democracy|democratic government]]. In 1840, the city councils started and some people could vote. [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] had its first elections in 1843, again with some limits on who could vote. In 1855, limited self-government was given by London to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. In 1855, the [[right to vote]] was given to all men over 21 in [[South Australia]]. The other colonies soon followed. Women were given the vote in the [[Parliament of South Australia]] in 1895 and they became the first women in the world allowed to stand in elections.&lt;ref name=\"aec.gov.au\"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/indigenous_vote/indigenous.htm |title=AEC.gov.au |publisher=AEC.gov.au |date=25 Oct. 2007 |accessdate=27 Jun. 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=8 Documenting Democracy] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/60vtMmmE7|date =2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\nAustralians had started parliamentary democracies all across the continent. But voices were getting louder for all of them to come together as one country with a national parliament.\\n\\n=== The Commonwealth of Australia ===\\n[[File:Opening of the first parliament.jpg|thumb|300px|A painting of the opening of the first [[Parliament of Australia]], 9 May 1901, painted by [[Tom Roberts]].

Retrieved 9 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;]]\\n\\nUntil 1901, Australia was not a [[nation]], it was six separate [[colony|colonies]] governed by Britain. They voted to join together to form one new country, called the Commonwealth of Australia, in 1901. Australia was still part of the [[British Empire]], and at first wanted only British or Europeans to come to Australia. But soon it had its own money, and its own Army and Navy.\\n\\nIn Australia at this time, the [[trade union]]s were very strong, and they started a political party, the [[Australian Labor Party]]. Australia passed many laws to help the [[worker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/wright.htm Women and the Right to Vote in Australia - Australian Electoral Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\nIn 1914, the [[World War I|First World War]] started in Europe. Australia joined in on the side of Britain against [[Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Australian soldiers were sent to [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. They fought bravely, but were beaten by the Turks. Today Australia remembers this battle every year on [[ANZAC Day]]. They also fought on the [[Western Front]]. More than 60,000 Australians were killed.\\n\\nAustralia had a really hard time in the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s and joined Britain in a war against [[Nazi Germany]] when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939. But in 1941 lots of Australian soldiers were captured in the [[Japanese Occupation of Singapore|Fall of Singapore]] by Japan. Then Japan started attacking Australia and people worried about invasion. But with help from the [[United States Navy]], the Japanese were stopped. After the war, Australia became a close friend of the United States.\\n\\nWhen the war ended, Australia felt that it needed many more people to fill the country up and to work. So the government said it would take in people from Europe who had lost their homes in the war. It did things like building the [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]]. Over the next 25 years, millions of people came to Australia. They came especially from [[Italy]] and [[Greece]], other countries in Europe. Later they also came from countries like [[Turkey]] and [[Lebanon]]. An important new party, the [[Liberal Party (Australia)|Liberal Party of Australia]] was made by [[Robert Menzies]] in 1944 and it won lots of elections from 1949 until in 1972, then [[Gough Whitlam]] won for the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]]. Whitlam made changes, but he made the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] unhappy and the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] sacked him and forced an election in 1975. Then [[Malcolm Fraser]] won a few elections for the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]].\\n\\nIn the 1960s many people began coming to Australia from [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Malaysia]] and other countries in [[Asia]]. Australia became more [[multicultural]]. In the 1950s and 1960s Australia became one of the richest countries in the world, helped by mining and wool. Australia started trading more with America, then Japan. Australia supported the United States in wars against [[dictatorship]]s in [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] and later [[Iraq]]. Australian soldiers also helped the [[United Nations]] in countries like [[East Timor]] in 1999.\\n\\nIn 1973, the famous [[Sydney Opera House]] opened. In the 1970s, 80s and 90s lots of [[Australian cinema|Australian movies]], actors and [[Australian music|singers]] became famous around the world. In the year 2000, [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney had the Summer Olympics]].\\n\\nIn the 1980s and 90s, the Labor Party under [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Paul Keating]], then the Liberal Party under [[John Howard]] made lots of changes to the economy. Australia had a bad [[recession]] in 1991, but when other Western countries [[Global financial crisis of September&#8211;October 2008|had trouble with their economies in 2008]], Australia stayed strong.\\n\\nToday Australia is a rich, peaceful and democratic country. But it still has problems. Around 4-5% of Australians could not get a job in 2010. A lot of land in Australia (like [[Uluru]]) has been returned to Aboriginal people, but lots of Aborigines are still poorer than everybody else. Every year the government chooses a big number of new people from all around the world to come as [[immigrant]]s to live in  Australia. These people may come because they want to do business, or to live in a democracy, to join their family, or because they are [[refugee]]s. Australia took 6.5 million immigrants in the 60 years after [[World War Two]], including around 660,000 refugees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html Australia in Brief: Australia - an overview - Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\n[[Julia Gillard]] became the first woman [[Prime Minister of Australia]] in 2010 when she replaced her colleague [[Kevin Rudd]] of the Labor Party.\\n\\n== Politics ==\\n[[File:Australian house of representatives04.jpg|thumb|left|The chamber of the [[Australian House of Representatives]] in [[Canberra]].]]\\n\\nAustralia is made up of six [[state]]s and three mainland [[wikt:territory|territories]].

       "['Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is a fictional [[boarding scho in [[J. K. Rowlin]\\'s best-selling \\'\\'[[Harry Pott\\'\\' series. It is a school of magic for witches and wizards between the ages of eleven and seventeen living in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Scotland.==Hogwarts houses=====Gryffindor===Gryffindor house was born under Godric Grand Gryffindor, from whom it gets the name. The house especially values [[coura. Its symbol (animal) is the Griffon and its colours are [[scarle](red-purple) and yellow / [[gold|goldish]] yellow. Nearly Headless Nick is the house ghost. The Gryffindors always compete with the Slytherins.The Gryffindor Common Room (the place where the Gryffindor students spend their time and do their homework) is in one of the castle\\'s towers, at the seventh floor. At the door, there is the Fat Lady, or the Lady who is fat. She lets the students in only after they give her the password (which changes from the beginning of the school year to the end of the school year). The Fat Lady wears a blue dress. In the room there is a place with fire, many chairs and tables, and two pair of stairs which take the girls and boys to their sleeping rooms.The head of Gryffindor house is Minerva McGonagall.List of well known Gryffindors===Hufflepuff===Hufflepuff house was born under Helga Hufflepuff, from whom it gets the name. The house especially values hard work, patience, friendship and fair play. Its symbol (animal) is the badger and its colours are [[black]] and [[yellow]]. The Fat Friar is the house ghost.The Hufflepuff Common Room door is near the kitchens, in the dungeons. It is a quite cozy and welcoming place, not at all like a dungeon. In the room there are yellow hangings and fat armchairs, with little underground tunnels that take the students to their sleeping rooms. The tunnels have round doors like barrel-tops.The head of Hufflepuff house is Pomona Sprout.Cedric Diggory dies in \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" book and movie.===Ravenclaw===Ravenclaw house was born under Rowena Ravenclaw, from whom it gets the name.

[[Image:Maillot blanc red-wings.JPG|thumb|200px|The Detroit Red Wings strip]]== History ===== Early history ===The Red Wings were formed in 1926.  The [[Western Canada Hockey Leagu] (WCHL) folded that year, and many of the players from the WCHL's [[Victoria Couga went to play for Detroit.  As a result, the team was first called the Detroit Cougars, then later it changed to Detroit Falcons, before becoming known as the Red Wings.=== Later history ===In the late [[1940], the [[line (sports)|lin] of Sid Abel, [[Gordie How], and Ted Lindsey became very important to the team.  Abel won the Hart Trophy in 1949, and Lindsey won the [[Art Ross Troph] as scoring champion in 1950.  Howe then won six Hart and six Art Ross Trophies between 1951 and 1963.  Terry Sawchuck was a star [[goaltend, who ended up with more career [[shutou]s than any other goalie (103).  Red Kelly won the first ever [[Norris Troph] as best defence.  As a result of having such great players, the Red Wings won four Stanley Cups in six years:  1950, 1952, 1954, and 1955.  Two of these were very close:  they were won in [[overtim] of the 7th and deciding game in 1950 (against the [[New York Range) and 1954 (against the Montreal Canadiens).  These are the only two times the NHL championship has gone to overtime of game seven.The Red Wings continued to be a strong team throughout the [[1960]].  They lost the NHL Finals five times between 1956 and 1966.  Norm Ullman was their star center in the 1960s.=== Comeback ===They were not a strong team again until the late 1980s.  Steve Yzerman became a star at this time.  Sergei Fedorov became the first [[Russi]n to win the Hart Trophy in 1994.  The Red Wings won the [[President's Cup]] as top team in the NHL regular season in 1995, 1996 (with a record number of wins), and 2002.  They won the Stanley Cup in 1997, 1998, and 2002.  Nicklas Lidstrom won the [[Norris Troph] as best defenceman three times beginning in 2001.  The team was one of the richest in the NHL, which helped them get many good players.== Winnings ==The Red Wings have won eleven [[Stanley Cup]]s, the third most of any team, and the most of the United States teams. They first won in 1936 and 1937, and again in 1943. Ebbie Goodfellow won the [[Hart Troph] as the NHL's [[most valuable play in 1940.  Sid Howe was also a star on the team at this time.==Related pages==*[[List of Detroit Red Wings playe==Other websites==*[http://redwings.nhl.com/ Official websit[[Category:Detroit Red Wings| ]][[Category:1926 establishmen\",\n",

Geology is the study of [[Rock (geology)|rock] in the [[Earth\\'s crus]. People who study geology are called geologists. Some geologists study [[miners and the useful substances the rocks contain (such as natural [[g and [[oi]). Geologists also study the [[history of the Earth]]. Some of the important [[even]s in the Earth\\'s history are [[flood]]s, [[volcano|volcanic eruption], [[earthquak]s, [[orogen] (mountain building), and [[plate tectonic] (movement of [[continen). Geology is divided into special subjects that study one part of geology. Some of these subjects are: * [[Geomorpholog] – the study of the shape (morphology) of the surface of the Earth.* [[Historical geolog] – the history of the events that shaped the Earth over the last 4.5 million years.* [[Aquifer|Hydrogeolog] – the study of water under the surface of the Earth* [[Palaeontolog] – the study of [[fossi]s* [[Petrolog] – the study of [[Rock (geology)|rock] how they form and where they are from.* [[Mineralog] – the study of [[miners* [[Sedimentolog] – the study of sediments* [[Stratigraph] – the study of layered [[sedimentary rock]]s and how they were deposited.* Structural geology– the study of folds and [[Fault (geology)|faul and how mountains are formed by uplift. See [[Earth scienc]* [[Volcanolog] – the study of [[volcan]es on land or under the [[ocean]]* [[Seismolog] – the study of [[earthquak]s and strong ground-motion.* Engineering geology -the study of geologic hazards (such as [[landslid]s and earthquakes) applied to [[civil engineerin].* Petroleum geology- the study of [[petroleu] deposits in sedimentary rocks.== Types of rock ==Rocks can be very different from each other.  Some are very hard and some are soft.  Some rocks are very common, while others are rare.  However, all the different rocks belong to three categories or types, igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic. * [[Igneous rock]] is rock that has been made by volcanic action.  Igneous rock is made when the [[lav] (melted rock on the surface of the Earth) or magma (melted rock below the surface of the Earth) cools and becomes hard.* [[Sedimentary rock]] is rock that has been made from [[sedimen].  Sediment is solid pieces of stuff that are moved by wind, water, or [[glacis, and dropped somewhere.  Sediment can be made from clay, [[sand]], [[grav and the bodies and [[Animal shell|shell] of animals.  The sediment gets dropped in a layer, usually in water at the bottom of a river or sea.  As the sediment piles up, the lowers layers get squashed together.  Slowly they set hard into rock.* [[Metamorphic rock]] is rock that has been changed.  Sometimes an igneous or a sedimentary rock is heated or squashed under the ground, so that it changes.  Metamorphic rock is often harder than the rock that it was before it changed.  [[Marbl] and [[sla are among the metamorphic rocks that people use to make things.=== Faults ===All three kinds of rock can be changed by being [[hea]ed and [[squeez]d by forces in the earth. When this happens, [[Fault (geology)|faul (cracks) may appear in the rock. Geologists can learn a lot about the history of the rock by studying the patterns of the fault lines. Earthquakes are caused when a fault breaks suddenly.=== Soil ===Soil is the stuff on the ground made of lots of particles (or tiny pieces). The particles of soil come from rocks that have broken down, and from rotting leaves and animals bodies. Soil covers a lot of the surface of the Earth. Plants of all sorts grow in soil.To find out more about types of rocks, see the \\'\\'[[rock (geolog\\'\\' article.To find out more about soil, see the \\'\\'[[soi]\\'\\' article.== Principles of Stratigraphy ==Geologists use some simple ideas which help them to understand the rocks they are studying. The following ideas were worked out in the early days of [[stratigraph] by people like [[Nicolaus Sten], [[James Hutton]] and [[william Smith (geologist)|William Smith]]: # Understanding the past: Geologist [[James Hutton]] said \"The present is the key to the past\". He meant that the sort of changes that are happening to the Earth\\'s surface now are the same sorts of things that happened in the past. Geologists can understand things that happened millions of years ago, by looking at the changes which are happening today.# [[Horizont [[stra: The layers in a sedimentary rock must have been horizontal (flat) when they were deposited (laid down).# The age of the strata: Layers at the bottom must be older than layers at the top, unless all the rocks have been turned over.# In sedimentary rocks that are made of [[sand]] or [[grav, the sand or gravel must have come from an older rock.# The age of [[Fault (geology)|faul: If there is a crack or fault in a rock, then the fault is younger than the rock. Rocks are in strata (lots of layers). A geologist can see if the faults go through all the layer, or only some. This helps to tell the age of the rocks.# The age of a rock which cuts through other rocks: If an [[igneous rock]] cuts across sedimentary layers, it must be younger than the sedimentary rock.# The relative age of [[fossi]s: A fossil in one rock type must be about the same age as the same type of fossil in the same type of rock \\'\\'in a different place\\'\\'. Likewise, a fossil in a rock layer below must be earlier than one in a higher layer.== Gallery ==<gallery> File:Salterncovenorth1.JPG|Layers of [[sedimentar] [[Rock (geology)|rock]]File:Appalachian fault.jpg|A [[Fault (geology)|faul] cutting through older sedimentary rocksFile:Schunemunk conglomerate and pine.jpg|A [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomera: sedimentary rock made from white pieces of older rock, broken up and mixed with red sand at the bottom of a river.File:Zimbabwe great dyke.jpg|The [[Zimbabw] Great [[Dyk]: A big band of [[igneou] rock cuts between sedimentary rocks.
